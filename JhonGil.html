<h1> <span>Now I Work For Corporate </span> </h1>
<div>
  <p class="top">
      I spent my first 5 years programming learning the "Vanillas" The fundemental basics of Computer Science that never change and with those you can build any new framework that trending right now. My foundation started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PHP because almost 80% of the internet uses it. Then I chose a "Write Once Run Everywhere" language as my main so I didn't just learn to declare my variable types on creation I was following a plan/curriculum I created before I even started on this "Ten Year Long" instead of a traditional four year long curriculum because even though I tend to learn faster in a shorter amount of time I learned to teach myself things at a fairly young age. The first project I assigned myself was to create a website but even though I've created websites before this was handwritten what they call source "Source Code" I progressed through Web Development fast I learned how to link source code documents together, HTML files to CSS files to Javascript files then I learned Frameworks like Bootstrap and JQuery and being self taught meant that I learned how to programm for fun.I couldn't quit my day job and I had the job everyone hated so for almost two years thats the job I had to do.I would study before work then go to work everyday and do the job everyone hated so I would hit way overrate everysingle day then I could go home and programm until I feel asleep. At first the only computer I had was a cheap android phone so I figured out ways to turn it into a server and host basic html packets until my phone died but how could I ever call myself a Computer Programmer if I  couldn't even own my own little slice of the internet and make it look however I wanted it to look.In less then two years I was working for one of the most powerful Tech Companies in the world. Its been 5 years now programming for 2.5./Almost 3 years I've been "In The Door Now" I've got expierence now and not just at no-name start up but a "Big Tech Company" one that before Bill Gates was Bill Gates the founder of Microsoft, Windows Computer, Microsoft Word  he came to Big Blue because even way back then Big Blue was Big Blue now companies like Google litterally call me. How many people get phone calls from google? At first I was mad when they placed me in SAP or should I say Enterprise Resources but I learned alot about data like Master Data,Transactional Data, SKEMAS,Data Cleasing, Report Development I'm a part of the Data Analytics Department I could take this data and run it through a Linear Regression Model or  Train a Nueral Network to procress it for me or I could just use SAP Analytics Cloud and just click a button the goal is still the same just to efficienly make sense of this big data.In all honesty to me nothing makes sense anymore, I have a Co-Worker who I love to death but he's been programming for less time then me we both started work at the exact same time. He now makes like 50% more than me now and granted he's insanaley intelligient but 43% percent of the internet is run off CMS's like Wordpress or Shopify. Someone told me I should go for a Web Developer Job because I have a website you can click view page source and tell that a human wrote that then check out my Android Developer Account https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8040499476760752928 its a completly different job so I havnt been able to touch it alot in almost 3 years say what you want to say but the fact its I get at least one promotion every year and if I don't I wonder why I'm still getting the Certifcations tgat are expected while being on a project as a junior doing half the reports under contract because instead of getting rid of you they bought you a little time and now I'f I ever apply to a SAP Analytics position it will be a senior position thats the thing about being a one trick pony if you don't become legacy code you run the danger or someone being able to learn your job in a day, a week,tops a month and do it better than you ... after years you realized you got complacenent! Fairy Land is when you walk throught a category 5 hurricane but still have to pay for advertising and you know your not crazy because you got it on video on purpose.Check out my Amazon FBA https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A1LT5J4ASKMQDK&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER and my Ecomerce site www.iownya.com after 5 years its like they talked shit about someone that they stole money from like an Estate that everyone knew who it was supposed to go to and now for the past 5 years they've taken half my check they ain't even building websites thats why I call it fairyland https://arzugil.com #BillionDollarStartup </p>

 <h1> <span> Got My Foot In The Door </span> </h1>
      <div>
<p class="middle">
I left Matcor and Michigan close to two months ago I applied for position at IBM as an Application Developer Apprentice.  All that studying, countless hours of programming, and taking notes finally really did pay off. I remember when all I had was a phone and a <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/9208201">sololearn </a> app eventually my mother sent me 500 dollars for Black Friday and I took 300 dollars of it and purchased a laptop from Walmart online that at the time the parts in the laptop added up individually cost more than the laptop and from there with 8 gb's of ddr4 ram and a AMD Ryzen 5 processor that I got just for its parallel processing power just in case if made it to some light machine learning / A.I and still couldn't afford a upgrade. And Now I work for IBM. One of the oldest most powerful tech companies in the world and my job for the next 12 months is to learn as much as possible so I can reapply for a better paying position... I Know I can't even believe it someone took a chance on me.

  <p class="middleBottom">
Hi soon I will be starting to create more of a blog like feel, I still don't know if its going to be on this domain or if I will purchase another one.
Still been really busy with work so I'm sorry I havn't been able to put as much at in as I would like doing what I love best creating things. 
      A hand made social media like website will take me some time being that I'm only one person with a fulltime job but I believe thats the best path moving forward.</p>

<h1> <span> About Me  </span> </h1>
<div>
<p class="bottom">
Hi! I'm <strong> Jhon </strong> A few weeks after I started my job at Matcor, I realized I was starting to grow
restless. Wake up work out then work on my Spanish then do finish some lessons in programming. Then after all that go to work at my fulltime job but it wasn't enough.
I still had too much free time. So a year ago i started my journey of teaching myself how 
to program/code. I didn't know where to start or even own a computer at the time so I downloaded an app on google play.
That eventually led me to <strong> SoloLearn </strong> where i started methodically going through the lessons. Then going over them again hoping
to memorize as much as possible in the hopes of having to <b> GOOGLE </b> less in the future. I hope that learning it in pieces
like learning my A,B,C,s will eventually transform me into a unique type of Programmer/Coder. One that learned his letters first and then realized 
    he could put them together to spell words.</p>
